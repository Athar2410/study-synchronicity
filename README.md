## 💡 Problem Statement 2: What's the Challenge?

> **"How can we make studying feel less isolating and more aligned with the lifestyle and attention span of Gen Z?"**

Study Sync addresses this with:
- Shared study-timer rooms
- Real-time sync between peers
- Built-in breaks to mimic Pomodoro
- A friendly, focused design that Gen Z can actually vibe with

- ⏱️ **Shared study sessions** with timer sync
- 👥 **Join or create rooms** to study with friends or strangers
- 🧠 **Built-in break reminders** using Pomodoro logic
- 💬 **Minimalist UI** with soft gradients and smooth transitions

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User lands on homepage → creates or joins a room
2. Timer starts in sync for all users in that room
3. After 25 minutes → break screen activates
4. Repeat cycle with room-level visibility
